## Chunking Strategies for Vector Databases (with detailed examples)

Here's a detailed breakdown of various chunking strategies, illustrated with examples:

**Text Chunking:**

1. **By Sentence:**

   * **Description:** Divides text into individual sentences using sentence boundary detection.
   * **Example:**
     ```
     Text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is a simple sentence."
     Chunks: 
       - "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
       - "This is a simple sentence."
     ```
   * **Best for:** Short texts where each sentence holds distinct information.

2. **By Paragraph:**

   * **Description:** Splits text based on paragraph breaks (usually denoted by line breaks).
   * **Example:**
     ```
     Text: "This is the first paragraph.\n\nThis is the second paragraph."
     Chunks:
       - "This is the first paragraph." 
       - "This is the second paragraph."
     ```
   * **Best for:** Texts where paragraphs represent coherent topics or ideas.

3. **By Fixed Token Length:**

   * **Description:** Divides text into chunks with a fixed number of tokens, respecting word boundaries.
   * **Example:** (Assume max token length = 5)
     ```
     Text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
     Chunks:
       - "The quick brown fox jumps"
       - "over the lazy dog." 
     ```
   * **Best for:** Controlling chunk size for models with specific input limitations.

4. **By Sliding Window:**

   * **Description:** Moves a fixed-size window across the text, creating overlapping chunks.
   * **Example:** (Window size: 3 sentences, Overlap: 1 sentence)
     ```
     Text: "Sentence 1. Sentence 2. Sentence 3. Sentence 4."
     Chunks:
       - "Sentence 1. Sentence 2. Sentence 3."
       - "Sentence 2. Sentence 3. Sentence 4."
     ```
   * **Best for:** Capturing context that spans multiple sentences/paragraphs.

5. **By Semantic Similarity:**

   * **Description:** Groups semantically similar sentences/paragraphs together using clustering algorithms.
   * **Example:**
     ```
     Text: "The cat sat on the mat. Dogs like to chase squirrels. The dog barked loudly."
     Chunks:
       - "The cat sat on the mat."
       - "Dogs like to chase squirrels. The dog barked loudly." 
     ```
   * **Best for:**  Improving retrieval accuracy by grouping related information.

6. **By Recursive Splitting:**

   * **Description:** Recursively divides long documents based on headings, sections, etc., until reaching a predefined chunk size limit.
   * **Example:** 
     ```
     Document:
       # Section 1
       This is the first section.

       ## Subsection 1.1
       This is a subsection.

       # Section 2
       Another section here.

     Chunks:
       - "# Section 1\nThis is the first section."
       - "## Subsection 1.1\nThis is a subsection."
       - "# Section 2\nAnother section here." 
     ```
   * **Best for:**  Handling documents with clear hierarchical structures.

**Code Chunking:**

1. **By Function/Method:**

   * **Description:** Splits code into individual functions or methods.
   * **Example:**
     ```python
     def calculate_sum(a, b):
         return a + b

     def calculate_difference(a, b):
         return a - b
     
     Chunks:
       - "def calculate_sum(a, b):\n  return a + b"
       - "def calculate_difference(a, b):\n  return a - b"
     ```
   * **Best for:**  Retrieving specific functionality based on function names or descriptions.

2. **By Code Block:**

   * **Description:** Divides code based on logical blocks like loops, conditional statements, etc.
   * **Example:**
     ```python
     for i in range(10):
         print(i)

     if x > 5:
         print("x is greater than 5") 
     
     Chunks:
       - "for i in range(10):\n  print(i)"
       - "if x > 5:\n  print("x is greater than 5")" 
     ```
   * **Best for:** Analyzing code structure and retrieving specific code patterns.

3. **By Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):**

   * **Description:** Utilizes the code's AST to define chunks based on meaningful code units.
   * **Example:** (Representing chunks based on AST nodes is complex, but the idea is to group related nodes)
     ```
     Code: `if (x > 5) { print("Hello"); }`
     Chunks:
       - `if (x > 5)` 
       - `{ print("Hello"); }`
     ```
   * **Best for:** Leveraging code structure for more accurate and context-aware chunking.

**Other Data Types:**

* **Time Series Data:** 
    - **Fixed time intervals:** Chunk by hour, day, week, etc.
    - **Change-point detection:**  Create new chunks when significant data shifts occur.
* **Image/Audio/Video Data:**
    - **Fixed-length segments:** Divide into equal-length parts.
    - **Object detection/Speech recognition:** Segment based on detected objects/spoken words. 

Remember that the best chunking strategy depends on your specific dataset, embedding model, and desired retrieval granularity. Experiment with different approaches to find the optimal solution for your use case.
